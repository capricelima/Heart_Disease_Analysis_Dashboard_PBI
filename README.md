# Power BI Dashboards on Cardiovascular Diseases

This project presents an analysis of cardiovascular disease data in Portugal, focusing on the relationship between hypertension and stroke (AVC). The datasets were obtained from the dados.gov.pt (https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/?q=arterial+ and https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/?q=Avc). After extraction, cleaning, and processing, several visualizations were developed in Power BI to illustrate patterns and correlations between these health conditions.

## Dashboard 1: Hypertension Associated with Cardiovascular Diseases

The first dashboard, was designed to explore the relationship between hemorrhagic stroke (AVC hemorrágico) and arterial hypertension. Since high blood pressure is a known risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, the dashboard focuses on comparing and correlating relevant data between 2019 and 2024.

### The visualizations include:

✔ Cards (KPI visuals) – Highlight the percentage averages of mortality from hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, making the contrast between them clearer.

✔ Slicers (Filters) – Allow data exploration by year, district, and region, enabling users to focus on specific subsets of the dataset.

✔ Stacked Column Chart – Shows the average mortality rates for hemorrhagic stroke vs. ischemic stroke. Results demonstrate that mortality from hemorrhagic stroke is consistently higher than ischemic stroke during the evaluated period.

✔ Line Chart – Displays the evolution of hemorrhagic stroke mortality rates alongside hospitalization rates due to arterial hypertension. The downward trends in both indicators suggest a correlation, where reduced hypertension rates are associated with reduced mortality from hemorrhagic stroke.

✔ Donut Chart – Illustrates the distribution of stroke occurrences across Portugal’s districts.

✔ Clustered Column Chart – Compares congestive heart failure rates with arterial hypertension rates between 2019 and 2024.

## Dashboard 2: Regional Trends in Hypertension and Stroke

The second dashboard emphasizes regional trends, providing a broader comparative view of hypertension and stroke data across Portugal.

### It contains:

✔ Two KPI Cards – Displaying the percentage rates of hospitalizations due to arterial hypertension and the average mortality from hemorrhagic stroke.

✔ Slicers (Filters) – Allow selection of data by year, district, and region.

✔ Multiple Line Chart – Shows average hemorrhagic stroke mortality rates by region and year.

✔ Clustered Column Chart – Represents hospitalization rates due to hypertension by region and year (2019–2024). The chart reveals a decreasing trend in hospitalization rates in three out of the five regions analyzed.

## Key Insights

✔ Hemorrhagic stroke mortality is consistently higher than ischemic stroke mortality.

✔ Both hypertension-related hospitalizations and hemorrhagic stroke mortality have shown a decline between 2019 and 2024 and the analysis and assembly of the graphs allow us to visualize this correlation.

✔ Regional analysis highlights that not all regions follow the same trend, though the general pattern points to improvement in most areas.
